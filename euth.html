              The AVMA is the American Veterinary Medical Association. They create a guidelides for animal care, and one of those guidelines is for euthanasia.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here are relevant excerpts from the <a href="https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-02/Guidelines-on-Euthanasia-2020.pdf" target="_blank">"AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2020 Edition"</a>. On the first page, 63 professionals are listed as contributors to this guideline.

              The AVMA Panel on Euthanasia develops the content of the guidelines, with support from its working groups. The panel is required to do a comprehensive review and update of the report at least every 10 years, although more frequent major revisions are possible based on substantive information gleaned from new research and experience with practical implementation. To ensure the guidelines remain as up-todate as possible, interim revisions (reflecting substantive updates, but of a less extensive nature than a major revision) are also accommodated.</p>

                  Carbon dioxide, with or without premedication with halogenated anesthetics, is acceptable with conditions for euthanasia of small rodents. 58 <br><br>Compressed CO2 gas in cylinders are the recommended source of CO2 because gas inflow to the chamber can be precisely regulated. An optimal flow rate for CO2 euthanasia systems should displace 30% to 70% of the chamber or cage volume/min, with the understanding that there is potential for increased distress due to dyspnea at lower flow rates or mucous membrane pain associated with flow rates at the high ends of this range. 31,32,54,56,59–64 However, as there is no clear evidence of a flow rate that optimally minimizes both pain and distress for all species, sexes, and genetic backgrounds, veterinarians should use their professional judgment to determine which flow rate is appropriate for their circumstances. 31,32,56
                  <br><br>Prefilled chambers are not recommended due to the potential for significant pain upon inhalation of the gas. 60,65 If euthanasia is not conducted in the home cage, induction chambers should be emptied and cleaned between uses.
                  <br><br>Addition of O2 to CO2 will prolong the time to death and may complicate determination of consciousness. There appears to be no advantage to combining O2 with CO2 for euthanasia. 11,60</p>

If handled correctly, rats and mice do not show evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis activation from decapitation or from being present when other rats or mice are decapitated.79,80 Decapitation is acceptable with conditions for mice and rats.

                Nonflammable volatile anesthetic agents are effective for in utero fetuses. <u>Neonatal mice may take up to 50 minutes to die from CO2 exposure</u>,93 and neonatal rats may take as long as 35 minutes.94 Adequate exposure time should be provided, or an adjunctive method (eg, cervical dislocation, or decapitation) should be performed after a neonate is nonresponsive to painful stimuli.

                The gradual cooling of fetuses and altricial neonates (mice and rats) is acceptable with conditions. There are no data to support the use of hypothermia as a single method, and it should be followed with a secondary method following loss of movement.
                <br><br>As cold surfaces can cause tissue damage and presumably pain, the animals should not come in direct contact with ice or precooled surfaces. Hypothermia for anesthesia is not recommended after approximately 10 days of age. 53,88 90,95–97 Therefore, it is also an unacceptable euthanasia method in animals older than this age.98

              <p>Page 42 <br>
                Euthanasia by manually applied blunt force trauma to the head must be evaluated in terms of the anatomic features of the species on which it is to be performed, the skill of those performing it, the number of animals to be euthanized, and the environment in which it is to be conducted. Manually applied blunt force trauma to the head can be a humane method of euthanasia for neonatal animals with thin craniums if a single sharp blow delivered to the central skull bones with sufficient force can produce immediate depression of the CNS and destruction of brain tissue.
                <br><br>When properly performed, loss of consciousness is rapid.
                <br><br>Personnel performing manually applied blunt force trauma to the head must be properly trained and monitored for proficiency with this method of euthanasia, and they must be aware of its aesthetic implications.
                <br><br>Manually applied blunt force trauma to the head has been used primarily to euthanize small laboratory animals with thin craniums.223,237,238 It has also been applied for euthanasia of young piglets. The anatomic features of neonatal calves make manually applied blunt force trauma to the head unacceptable as a method of euthanasia for this species.
                <br><br>Personnel who have to perform manually applied blunt force trauma to the head often find it displeasing and soon become fatigued. Fatigue can lead to inconsistency in application, creating humane concerns about its efficacious application to large numbers of animals. For this reason, the AVMA encourages those using manually applied blunt force trauma to the head as a euthanasia method to actively search for alternate approaches.
                </p>
  
                <ol><strong>Advantages</strong>
                <li> Blunt force trauma applied manually to the head is inexpensive and effective when performed correctly.</li>
                <li>Blunt force trauma does not chemically contaminate tissues.</li>
                </ol>
  
                <ol><strong>Disadvantages</strong>
                <li>Manually applied blunt force trauma is displeasing for personnel who have to perform it.</li>
                <li>Repeatedly performing manually applied blunt force trauma can result in personnel fatigue, loss of efficacy, and humane concerns.</li>
                <li>Trauma to the cranium can damage tissues and interfere with diagnosis of brain diseases.</li>
                </ol>
  
                <p class="p1">
                <strong>General recommendations</strong>
                <br>Replace, as much as possible, manually applied blunt force trauma to the head with alternate methods. Manually applied blunt force trauma is not acceptable for neonatal calves, because of their anatomic features.
